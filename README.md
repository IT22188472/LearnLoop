# LearnLoop
In a world where learning is increasingly community-centric and self-paced, the need for a digital ecosystem that encourages both skill-sharing and personal growth has never been greater. As part of the IT3030 – Programming Applications and Frameworks (PAF) module at SLIIT, our team is undertaking the development of a comprehensive Skill-Sharing & Learning Platform—a modern web application that empowers individuals to learn, teach, engage, and grow together through shared knowledge and experiences.In a world where learning is increasingly community-centric and self-paced, the need for a digital ecosystem that encourages both skill-sharing and personal growth has never been greater.
